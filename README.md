<h1>Flicker</h1>

Flicker is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:


- [x] Fade in images in 2s if not cached
- [x] Added Launch Screen
- [x] Customize Tab Bar

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. After getting the high res image, how can we make it so that future taps on this movie will only show the high res and ignore the low res?
2. How can we improve the UIUX in general? The detailViewController is not excellent.

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
